# Updated version

This was a demo used during HashiTalks Africa on 30 April 2020, and has been turned into 2 updated tutorials:

* [Bootstrapping your Terraform automation with Amazon CodeCatalyst](bit.ly/bootstrapping-terraform)
* [Automating Multiple Environments with Terraform](bit.ly/multi-account-terraform)

You can use the implementation in these to also use GitHub Actions if you prefer to manage multiple environments.
